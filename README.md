The AI-Based Discount Detection System for Retail Sections using OpenVINO is an innovative computer vision solution designed to personalize in-store marketing strategies through real-time video analytics. The core idea of the project is to automatically identify retail store sections with low footfall and introduce limited-time discounts to attract more customers to those areas. The system works by analyzing video input—either from a static video or a live camera feed—dividing the store area into configurable sections, and then applying a person detection model (YOLOv8) accelerated using Intel’s OpenVINO toolkit for efficient inference.

At the heart of the logic lies continuous object detection in each frame, where the model identifies all objects and filters out only those with a “person” class label. The frame width is evenly divided based on the number of sections provided by the user. For each detected person, the system calculates the horizontal midpoint of their bounding box to determine which section they fall into. It maintains a count of people in each section and tracks this over time using timers.

If the count of people in a section remains at one or zero for more than 10 seconds, the system activates a virtual “discount” for that section, visually displaying a message such as “20% DISCOUNT ON THIS SECTION FOR NEXT 20 MINUTES”. This message appears directly within the boundaries of that section to attract visual attention. The logic also ensures that if more than 10 people accumulate in any section or new activity is detected, the discount is removed or reset, keeping the system dynamic and context-aware.

The system leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model converted to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format for faster execution, especially on edge devices or Intel CPUs/VPUs. It uses OpenCV for video processing, real-time frame handling, overlay rendering, and drawing section boundaries. This intelligent setup demonstrates how AI can influence customer behavior, optimize in-store layout utilization, and dynamically boost underperforming areas in a store without manual intervention.

Overall, this project merges AI, computer vision, and real-time decision-making to simulate how retail analytics can be automated and enhanced using edge-friendly AI solutions like OpenVINO. The system is scalable, and with further enhancements such as integrating customer heatmaps, dwell time analysis, or alert-based marketing dashboards, it can evolve into a complete smart retail management tool.
